# Extraction Patterns: Regex patterns for extracting entities from structured text
# Purpose: Pre-extract entities using regex before LLM processing (faster, more accurate for structured data)
# Usage: Can extract entities before LLM processing, or validate/supplement LLM-extracted entities
# Format: Regex with named groups that map to entity types and attributes
